Introduction
============

The [Lomo Supersampler][1] is an analog camera which takes four
pictures in quick succession, exposed in stripes on a single 35 mm
photo. A small part in the advance mechanism breaks easily. I think I
broke it when rewinding the film without pressing the button at the
bottom.

I then created 3D prints for the broken parts.

Samples were printed by [WeNext][2] in:

  * Somos GP Plus 14122 (white resin, SLA)
  
  * Somos WaterShed XC 11122 (clear resin, SLA)
  
  * HP 3D High Reusability PA 12 (black nylon, MJF)
  
The Somos GP Plus 14122 part broke on first try, possibly when
rewinding the film after successfully shooting around 12 exposures
before the advance mechanism got stuck.

Currently in the camera is the HP 3D High Reusability PA 12, sanded
down slightly.

Note that when replacing the part, it is better not to tighten the
screws of the advance mechanism’s housing too tight. Otherwise the
string won’t pull back in.
